pick random PREFERREDCOLOR
pick random AREA [see table below]
scale properly, depends on AREA
offset if AREA has even width and height
pick random number BLOCS with range depending on AREA
find "factors" of BLOCS (actually modulo number by BLOCSIZE)
  if not divisible by 9,7,5,3: try again 
    [the reason why I exclude evens is so that you can't have equal amount of blue/orange per district]
  else pick highest of the above numbers
divide BLOCS by BLOCSIZE to get DISTRICTS

  "starting again" leads back here
  
for each DISTRICT
  generate a polymino with BLOCS squares
  choose random location within the area
  if it can be placed, place it
    otherwise, check if there is an empty space with at least BLOCS squares (?)
      if there is, place polymino that fits
      if there isn't, reset polymino arrangement and start again {falls apart here}
set VALID to true if there is at least one square on all four edges and all squares are connected
if not VALID, reset polymino arrangement and start again

for each DISTRICT [we have two fors so we don't need to work out colors for failing arrangements]
  if DISTRICT is even or 1, color majority (always minority plus 1) PREFERREDCOLOR
    else color minority PREFERREDCOLOR
	either way color remaining squares other color
